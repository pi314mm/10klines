# 10klines
Several interview questions ask for coding proficiency. This is measured in number of lines committed to an open source framework or whatever.

Here is an open source chunk of code thingy I contributed to. Each file has over 10k lines of code. Just that most the lines are newlines

This is not intended for actual swe interviews. I will answer honestly for any interview. But I do disagree with using lines of code written as an absolute metric for proficiency
